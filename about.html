                       <h1>Welcome to my webpage</h1>
                       <p> Hello and welcome, my name is Michael Smith and I am an Electrical Enginnering student at Bradley University. The summer of 
                           2021 I recieved an intership from an engineering contracting firm called; Burns and McDonnel. I spent the summer designing fiber-optic 
                           telecommunication systems, a task that I excelled at. At the end of the summer a job offer for a full time position was made.
                       </p>

                       <p>I am a non-traditional student that enlisted into the United States Marine Corps. after graduating highschool. I gained the position of 'point-man'
                           and opperated in a 6-man Recon team in this position for six years during my enlistment. 
                           After I was discharged form the military I enrolled in college and began my path toward becoming an electrical engineer with a minor in computer 
                           science. I will be graduating in 2022 and beginning my career at Burns and McDonnel the following summer.

           my abilty to confidently read <b><em>AND</em></b> create complex code has set me apart from my fellow electrical engineering students. <i>not to mention how much fun Bradley's COMPUTER SCIENCE courses have been!</i>
